# Anamesis Store

**An AI-native commerce platform for clarity, focus, and regenerative living.**

Anamesis Store is designed to offer high-integrity product recommendations across six life-shaping categoriesâ€”free of ads, pressure, or extractive incentives. It starts as a minimalist storefront, but evolves into a dual-intelligence platform: one layer for users, and one for automated business-side operations powered by AI.
